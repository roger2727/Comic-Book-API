### **The purpose for building this app**

<br>

I own a lot of comic books, and I can never remember what I have. I hate flicking through piles to see which ones I have because they get damaged, are messy, and can waste a lot of time. So if I have an app with a list that I can go through, it will save a lot of time and prevent my comics from getting damaged. Also, sometimes I need help deciding which one to read because I could spend hrs deciding. The app will generate a random comic book which will solve this problem. As a collector of comic books, I always wonder how much all my comics are worth, so the app will tell me how many comics I have and what they are worth to keep track of my investments.
